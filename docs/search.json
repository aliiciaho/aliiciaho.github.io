    "text": "What are the trends in Mental Health Disorders across the globe?\nMental Health refers to “mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community” (World Health Organization, 2022b). Mental health disorders are “characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition, emotional regulation, or behaviour” (World Health Organization, 2022a). There are a multitude of mental health disorders that exist. On this website, the data analysed are focused on 7 Mental Health Disorders — Alcohol use disorder, Anxiety disorder, Bipolar disorder, Depression, Drug use disorder, Eating disorder and Schizophrenia.\nA study by researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of Queensland have found that one out of every two people in the world will develop a mental health disorder in their lifetime (Queensland Brain Institute, 2023). This shows how prevalent mental health disorders have been in recent years. It is crucial to find out the main type and cause of mental health disorders in order to deal with them effectively. The current treatments used to deal with these disorder have not been very effective, hence data in this area of study will allow for greater ease of finding an effective treatment (Queensland Brain Institute, 2023).\nThis data story provides a visualisation for Mental Health Disorders across the globe from 1990-2017. It is meant to bring awareness to the mental health issues that people experience, albeit the small percentage it seems to take up of the whole population. Understanding the trends, disparities, and progress in mental health over time is crucial for effective intervention and policy-making. It is important to note that not all who suffer from mental health disorders seek help and are being reported in the dataset.\n\n\nDataset Used\nThe dataset used includes the columns:\n\nIndex: A unique number attached to each observation\nEntity: Country name\nCode: Country Code\nYear: Year of data observed\nSchizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, Eating disorders, Anxiety Disorders, Drug use Disorders, Depression, Alcohol Use Disorders: Percenatge of people reported to have the specific mental health disorder\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\nEntity\nCode\nYear\nSchizophrenia\nBipolar_Disorder\nEating_Disorder\nAnxiety_Disorder\nDruguse_Disorder\nDepression\nAlcoholuse_Disorder\n\n\n\n\n0\nAfghanistan\nAFG\n1990\n0.160560\n0.697779\n0.101855\n4.828830\n1.677082\n4.071831\n0.672404\n\n\n1\nAfghanistan\nAFG\n1991\n0.160312\n0.697961\n0.099313\n4.829740\n1.684746\n4.079531\n0.671768\n\n\n2\nAfghanistan\nAFG\n1992\n0.160135\n0.698107\n0.096692\n4.831108\n1.694334\n4.088358\n0.670644\n\n\n3\nAfghanistan\nAFG\n1993\n0.160037\n0.698257\n0.094336\n4.830864\n1.705320\n4.096190\n0.669738\n\n\n4\nAfghanistan\nAFG\n1994\n0.160022\n0.698469\n0.092439\n4.829423\n1.716069\n4.099582\n0.669260\n\n\n5\nAfghanistan\nAFG\n1995\n0.160076\n0.698695\n0.090980\n4.828337\n1.728112\n4.104207\n0.668746\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a total of 168 countries that will be used in these visualisations.\n\n\nMental Health Disorder trend for each country\nBelow, you can find an interactive graph. Select the country you are interested in and its relevant graph will be produced.\n \n\n\nOverall trends of mental health disorder\n\nWhich disorders should we be concerned about?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above shows that the dominant mental health disorders that prevail in 2017 are Anxiety disorders and Depression.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trend of median percentages of mental health disorders across 1990-2017 shows that there are no significant increases or decreases. Although this shows that dealing with mental health disorders is not an issue of high priority, it also signifies that the current methods of improving individuals’ mental health are not effective.\n\n\n\nWhich countries should pay greater attention to their citizens’ mental health?\n\n\nLimitations\nThe data that was curated only contains data up to 2017. Hence, it is not the most accurate representation of the current mental states of people in the world. With the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2019, research has shown that mental health has deteriorated immensely (cite). Ideally, the visualisations shown would include the most recent data for stakeholders to identify current poignant mental health issues that are on the rise.\nSome countries are not included because of the mismatch of data between the countries in the global map and the countries in the mental health dataset."

    "text": "About me\nI am Alicia Ho, an NUS student majoring in Music at the YST Conservatory of Music.\n\n\nWhy did I choose this topic?\nMy initial idea was to analyse mental health conditions based on the type of music that one listens to. Since I study music, I thought that this topic would be more relatable to me. However, I found that the trends were not clear and there was no strong conclusion that could be drawn from the data. Hence, I decided to explore mental health disorders on a more general level.\nI think that in Singapore, and maybe some other parts of the world, mental health is still not talked about enough. There is still some stigma attached to getting therapy and older generations may think that getting help for certain mental conditions is just a sign of weakness. However, I think that these mental health disorders should be dealt with more seriously as it affects the quality of our lives to a large extent.\nHence, I hope that this visualisation will bring to light the prevalence of mental health disorders and certain trends that are observed based on this data.\n\n\nCredits\nThe link to the data of mental health disorders worldwide can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncover-global-trends-in-mental-health-disorder?resource=download\nThe link to the leaflet data to create the world map can be found here: https://github.com/lvictory/maps-data/blame/master/world.geo.json\n\n\nReferences\nPavel Grigoriev, & Bobrova, A.
