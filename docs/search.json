    "text": "What are the trends in Mental Health Disorders across the globe?\nMental Health refers to “mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community” (World Health Organization, 2022b). Mental health disorders are “characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition, emotional regulation, or behaviour” (World Health Organization, 2022a). There are a multitude of mental health disorders that exist. On this website, the data analysed are focused on 7 Mental Health Disorders — Alcohol use disorder, Anxiety disorder, Bipolar disorder, Depression, Drug use disorder, Eating disorder and Schizophrenia.\nA study by researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of Queensland have found that one out of every two people in the world will develop a mental health disorder in their lifetime (Queensland Brain Institute, 2023). This shows how prevalent mental health disorders have been in recent years. It is crucial to find out the main type and cause of mental health disorders in order to deal with them effectively. The current treatments used to deal with these disorder have not been very effective, hence data in this area of study will allow for greater ease of finding an effective treatment (Queensland Brain Institute, 2023).\nThis data story provides a visualisation for Mental Health Disorders across the globe from 1990-2017. It is meant to bring awareness to the mental health issues that people experience, albeit the small percentage it seems to take up of the whole population. Understanding the trends, disparities, and progress in mental health over time is crucial for effective intervention and policy-making. It is important to note that not all who suffer from mental health disorders seek help and are being reported in the dataset.\n\n\nDataset Used\nThe dataset used includes the columns:\n\nIndex: A unique number attached to each observation\nEntity: Country name\nCode: Country Code\nYear: Year of data observed\nSchizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, Eating disorders, Anxiety Disorders, Drug use Disorders, Depression, Alcohol Use Disorders: Percenatge of people reported to have the specific mental health disorder\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\nEntity\nCode\nYear\nSchizophrenia\nBipolar_Disorder\nEating_Disorder\nAnxiety_Disorder\nDruguse_Disorder\nDepression\nAlcoholuse_Disorder\n\n\n\n\n0\nAfghanistan\nAFG\n1990\n0.160560\n0.697779\n0.101855\n4.828830\n1.677082\n4.071831\n0.672404\n\n\n1\nAfghanistan\nAFG\n1991\n0.160312\n0.697961\n0.099313\n4.829740\n1.684746\n4.079531\n0.671768\n\n\n2\nAfghanistan\nAFG\n1992\n0.160135\n0.698107\n0.096692\n4.831108\n1.694334\n4.088358\n0.670644\n\n\n3\nAfghanistan\nAFG\n1993\n0.160037\n0.698257\n0.094336\n4.830864\n1.705320\n4.096190\n0.669738\n\n\n4\nAfghanistan\nAFG\n1994\n0.160022\n0.698469\n0.092439\n4.829423\n1.716069\n4.099582\n0.669260\n\n\n5\nAfghanistan\nAFG\n1995\n0.160076\n0.698695\n0.090980\n4.828337\n1.728112\n4.104207\n0.668746\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a total of 168 countries that will be used in these visualisations.\n\n\nOverall trends of mental health disorder\n\nWhich disorders should we be concerned about?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above shows that the dominant mental health disorders that prevail in 2017 are Anxiety disorders, followed by Depression and Alcohol Use Disorder.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trend of median percentages of mental health disorders across 1990-2017 shows that there are no significant increases or decreases. Although this shows that dealing with mental health disorders is not an issue of high priority, it also signifies that the current methods of improving individuals’ mental health are not effective.\n\n\n\nWhich countries should pay greater attention to their citizens’ mental health?\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\nAnxiety\nDepression\nAlcohol_Use_Disorder\nDrug_Use_Disorder\nBipolar_Disorder\nEating_Disorder\nSchizophrenia\n\n\n\n\n1\nNew Zealand\nGreenland\nBelarus\nUnited States\nNew Zealand\nAustralia\nAustralia\n\n\n2\nNorway\nLesotho\nRussia\nUnited Arab Emirates\nAustralia\nLuxembourg\nNetherlands\n\n\n3\nIran\nMoroco\nEstonia\nLibya\nBrazil\nSpain\nNew Zealand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank 1 indicates highest percentage of population with the mental health disorder\nHover over the country of interest to find out the most recent mental health disorder data (2017).

Select the country you are interested in and its relevant graph will be produced.\n \n\n\nLimitations\nThe data that was curated only contains data up to 2017. Hence, it is not the most accurate representation of the current mental states of people in the world. With the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2019, research has shown that mental health has deteriorated immensely (cite). Ideally, the visualisations shown would include the most recent data for stakeholders to identify current poignant mental health issues that are on the rise.\nSome countries are not included because of the mismatch of data between the countries in the global map and the countries in the mental health dataset.

    "text": "About me\nI am Alicia Ho, an NUS student majoring in Music at the YST Conservatory of Music.\n\n\nWhy did I choose this topic?\nMy initial idea was to analyse mental health conditions based on the type of music that one listens to. Since I study music, I thought that this topic would be more relatable to me. However, I found that the trends were not clear and there was no strong conclusion that could be drawn from the data. Hence, I decided to explore mental health disorders on a more general level.\nI think that in Singapore, and maybe some other parts of the world, mental health is still not talked about enough. There is still some stigma attached to getting therapy and older generations may think that getting help for certain mental conditions is just a sign of weakness. However, I think that these mental health disorders should be dealt with more seriously as it affects the quality of our lives to a large extent.\nHence, I hope that this visualisation will bring to light the prevalence of mental health disorders and certain trends that are observed based on this data.\n\n\nCredits\nThe link to the data of mental health disorders worldwide can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncover-global-trends-in-mental-health-disorder?resource=download\nThe link to the leaflet data to create the world map can be found here: https://github.com/lvictory/maps-data/blame/master/world.geo.json\n\n\nReferences\nAsciutto, R., Lugo, A., Pacifici, R., Colombo, P., Rota, M., Carlo La Vecchia, & Gallus, S.

Depression seems to be prevalent in countries all over the world, in spite of difference in culture, economic and development status. Greenland has one of the highest rates of suicide in the world, which occurred due to feelings of isolation and depression (Jones, 2020). Most of Greenland’s population consists of Inuit Indigenous people, who have needed to make major changes in their lifestyles to adapt to changing climates (Jones, 2020).\nSome of these countries experiencing high depression rates are experiencing conflict in the region. Examples include countries in North Africa and the Middle East, such as Palestine, Iran, Lesotho and Morocco. The disruptions to their way of life and constant worries about their own lives and their loved ones’, are factors that play into the higher rates of depression.\nHowever, even countries that are seemingly politically stable and are developed economies such as the United States, Australia and Sweden also have high depression rates. Research shows that this is because more developed countries have more resources to collect data on depression compared to less developed countries. However, the fact that these percentages are considerably high, especially compared to other mental health disorders, shows that it is a problem that should be resolved.\n\nAre there countries who have dealt with depression effectively?\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\nEntity\nCode\nYear\nDepression\n\n\n\n\n168\nColombia\nCOL\n2017\n2.196154\n\n\n167\nAlbania\nALB\n2017\n2.208414\n\n\n165\nPoland\nPOL\n2017\n2.250472\n\n\n164\nPeru\nPER\n2017\n2.276321\n\n\n163\nMyanmar\nMMR\n2017\n2.300982\n\n\n162\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nBIH\n2017\n2.319610\n\n\n161\nMacedonia\nMKD\n2017\n2.332386\n\n\n160\nRomania\nROU\n2017\n2.359174\n\n\n159\nSlovakia\nSVK\n2017\n2.401999\n\n\n158\nBulgaria\nBGR\n2017\n2.543141\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough these countries have the lowest depression rates, these percentages are still high compared to other mental health disorders. The lowest value (2.196) is higher than the median value of alcohol use disorder, the third most prevalent disorder (1.508). Most of these countries seem to originate from the Balkans, the southeastern part of Europe. The Western Balkans have been implementing policies to improve their mental healthcare services from asylum-based to community-based for the past 2 decades (World Health Organization, 2022c). Although changes in depression rates seem to be inconsistent over the past few decades, perhaps these programmes can be a foundation to be built upon and mirrorred in other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary: The main drivers of increased depression rates are political instability, and ironically, developed countries. The Western Balkans have made some improvements after implementing new policies under the guidance of the World Health Organisation, which can be learnt from."

Studies have shown that this is because more developed countries have greater awareness about mental health disorders and better indicators and resources to detect anxiety within people (Shahbazi et al., 2022). However, compared to other mental health disorders, anxiety takes up a distinctly large percentage of the population. Though its median (3.57) is not far from Depression (3.51), its upper quartile is larger by about 1%.\nIn developed countries, large disparities in income inequality may place pressure on individuals to maintain their social status in society. Additionally, individuals are more likely to consume a diet heavy in processed foods, sodium, and sugar, which can catalyze psychophysiological reactions that impact mood and elevate symptoms such as stress and anxiety (Syed Fahad Javaid et al., 2023). With greater accessibility to social media and technology in developed countries, insecurities in self-image can develop and affect anxiety levels.\nWith the greater amount of resources that developed countries have, it is essential to invest in not only raising awareness about anxiety disorders, but also providing accessible treatment and promoting a lifestyle to citizens that lowers anxiety.\n\nAre developing countries less anxious?\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\nEntity\nCode\nYear\nAnxiety\n\n\n\n\n168\nVietnam\nVNM\n2017\n2.066871\n\n\n167\nColombia\nCOL\n2017\n2.514803\n\n\n165\nTajikistan\nTJK\n2017\n2.524336\n\n\n164\nUzbekistan\nUZB\n2017\n2.560435\n\n\n163\nKyrgyzstan\nKGZ\n2017\n2.562742\n\n\n162\nTurkmenistan\nTKM\n2017\n2.567311\n\n\n161\nMongolia\nMNG\n2017\n2.575180\n\n\n160\nAzerbaijan\nAZE\n2017\n2.583157\n\n\n159\nArmenia\nARM\n2017\n2.592813\n\n\n158\nGeorgia\nGEO\n2017\n2.602456\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to depression, even the lowest percentages of anxiety disorders are higher than the median percentages of other mental health disorders. This shows that anxiety is a prevalent issue globally. Geographically, countries with the lowest anxiety rates originate from Central Asia and countries that border Europe and Asia. It is interesting to note that some of these countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan and Georgia used to be part of the Soviet Union. There is a legacy that has maintained on the Soviet healthcare system, which uses psychiatry as a political tool (Hook & Bogdanov, 2021). This creates a lot of stigma surrounding mental health and reduces accessibility to mental health care services.\nUnfortunately, the low anxiety levels are attributed to lack of education on anxiety disorders rather than a sign of good anxiety management.\nSummary: In developed countries, there has been greater awareness on anxiety, contributing to a higher percentage of the population being diagnosed. However, there are cultural and societal factors that are the main drivers of anxiety that should be tackled. In East European and Central Asian countries, governments and organisations should work to reduce stigma surrounding mental health and provide better mental health care services to its citizens."
